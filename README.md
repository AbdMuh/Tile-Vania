Player Experience
1. Core Gameplay Loop:
The player navigates through complex level designs, overcoming platforming challenges, collecting coins, and eliminating enemies to reach the end of each level.
Each level tests the player’s reflexes, timing, and ability to strategize around enemy placement and environmental hazards.
2. Challenge and Reward:
The game provides a gradual increase in difficulty, with levels becoming more demanding in terms of platforming and combat.
Collecting all coins serves as a secondary challenge, rewarding exploration and thoroughness with higher scores.
Defeating enemies requires careful timing due to the 3-hit requirement, adding tension to the gameplay.
3. Death and Retry:
Each death brings the player closer to losing all lives. The game fosters a sense of urgency as the player progresses through the levels, knowing that losing all lives will send them back to the start.
Upon losing all lives, the player must restart from the first level, reinforcing the importance of careful play and memorization of enemy and hazard placements.
Game Loop
Start of Game:

The player begins with Ray in a safe starting location with 3 lives and a score of 0.
Exploration and Progression:

The player moves through the level, encountering enemies, platforms, and hazards. The player must collect coins, defeat enemies, and navigate to the end of the level.
Levels are designed to promote exploration, platforming skills, and environmental interaction (jumping, bouncing on mushrooms, climbing ladders).
Combat and Engagement:

The player must engage enemies strategically using Ray’s gun. Each enemy requires 3 shots to be killed, adding a layer of strategy to when and how the player chooses to attack.
Collectibles and Scoring:

Coins serve as a secondary objective, encouraging players to fully explore the level while being rewarded for their efforts. The player receives 10 points for each coin collected.
End of Level:

Upon reaching the end of a level, the player progresses to the next level. The challenge increases as the player advances, with more complex platforming sections and tougher enemy encounters.
Death and Life Management:

If Ray is hit by a hazard (spikes, enemies), he loses a life. If all lives are lost, the game restarts from level 1, and the player must replay previous levels to progress again.
Game Completion:

The game is complete when the player successfully navigates all 5 levels and survives with at least 1 life remaining. The player’s score is determined by the number of coins collected and remaining lives.
Game Objectives
Primary Objective:
Reach the end of each level while avoiding hazards and enemies.
Secondary Objective:
Collect all coins to maximize your score (10 points per coin).
Survival Objective:
Complete all 5 levels with the 3 lives provided. Losing all lives restarts the game from level 1.
